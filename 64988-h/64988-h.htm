<p>THE BEGINNING of the caravan&#8217;s trip was made
through lovely country, through regions in which
flowers such as tea roses and white and purple iris
bloomed. When the caravan came through villages,
boys ran out barefoot and half-naked to sell fruit to
the travelers: baskets of peaches, pears, and melons.
All the forty camels wore bells, each one several
little silver-tongued bells attached to the harness
he wore around his neck. The youngest camel
was the only one who did not carry a bell, nor a
load on his back. This was the first trip he had
ever made across the desert and he followed close
behind his mother. As long as she was there before
him, he felt quite pleased with himself and not at
all fearful of all the sights he saw.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>After several days the caravan, like every other
caravan that took this route, entered the badlands.
Here the older camels fell into sudden rages and
spat if anyone approached them. If the camel
drivers jerked their nose cords, they flung their
legs about and tottered as if they were about to
faint. Now and then, towards sundown, when the
hour to halt seemed near, they screamed aloud like
humans. But the camels grew quieter as soon as
the desert began and they felt their feet deep in the
hot slipping sand.</p>

<p>The early mornings were now a clear icy blue,
but as the day advanced the heat blazed up as if a
fire were sweeping across the heavens towards
them. The youngest camel didn&#8217;t mind how hot
it was and he had such a good opinion of his own
strength that he thought he could never possibly
get tired. He came skipping and jumping along
behind his mother, playing games with himself and
laughing out loud when the dry sand ran swift as
water between his toes. But when his mother complained
of the terrible heat and the long way they
had to go, he lifted his soft dark eyes and looked
at her long legs before him, and her tail, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
thought: I love her. I love her elbows with the hair
worn off them, like the old carpet the snake
charmer sits on in the market place; I love the
way her hump slumps when she has no more water
in it, and I love the way her tail is eaten by the
moths because she forgot to put it in camphor once
about fifty years ago.</p>

<p>He was a very poetic young camel and rather
musical besides. He had a beautiful singing voice,
and in the evenings when they halted at an oasis
he liked to play the harp and sing to her. Most
of his songs were about himself and his own beauty
and grace, but sometimes at night his songs were
so tender in his love for her that she had to rise
from her knees and break off great leaves from the
banana trees and dry the tears from her aging face.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth night they halted at an oasis
where the poplars and mimosas grew in great profusion,
and where hares and antelope moved shyly
in the cool green gorges. The stars were sprinkled
out as fine as salt across the bluish night sky. The
youngest camel lay close beside his mother in the
moist grasses, and she said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flower of my heart, this trip you have followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
close beside me, for you are my baby still, but soon
you must prepare yourself for what will surely
come. Perhaps when we reach the end of our journey
you will be taken from me, and from then on
you will travel with strange camels, carrying a load
of your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A baby?&#8221; said the youngest camel in surprise,
feeling a little annoyed. &#8220;Me, a baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his mother sadly, &#8220;and so, my earliest
leaf, you will have to undergo the ordeal of
loneliness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world is that?&#8221; asked the young
camel, and he reached out for his harp and lightly
touched its strings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ordeal of loneliness is the thing we camels
fear the most,&#8221; said his mother, and he sat listening
to her rather impatiently, swinging his little
golden chin back and forth as he chewed on a bit
of grass. &#8220;Men have found out,&#8221; she went on, lowering
her voice, &#8220;that what we fear above everything
else is being left alone. So they take us one
by one when we are very young like you, and they
tie us fast and leave us in solitude three days and
three nights in the desert. If we live through that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and keep our reason, then we&#8217;re cured. After that
we no longer fear the terrible sight of nothingness
around us. But sometimes we do not live through
it. You must be prepared for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, me?&#8221; said the youngest camel with a
laugh. &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;ll mind? Why, not at all.
I&#8217;m a little bit afraid of fire, and I don&#8217;t quite like
things that lie still and refuse to move any more.
But generally I&#8217;m much more brave than other
young camels, and I couldn&#8217;t possibly be afraid of
being alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so close to his mother&#8217;s side that this
seemed like a fairy story she told him. And all
around them the oasis was filled with sleeping life.
Near the trees, the mules stood tethered, their tails
swinging back and forth in the warm night air.
Against the starry sky, the necks and heads of the
forty kneeling camels stood out, peaceful as statues.
Danger seemed a thing too far away to think of,
even.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; his mother went on as she smoothed his
hair back from his brow. &#8220;At first you will be very
much afraid, but you must try to remember there
is nothing really to fear. Remember, it is only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
beating of our own hearts that makes us tremble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young camel laughed a little in contempt
at the idea of being afraid of anything at all, and
then he began to draw music from his harp. No
one moved, nothing stirred except the mules&#8217; tails
slowly waving in the tall grass, but his mother
began to cry silently while he sang.</p>

<p>THE NEXT morning the youngest camel awoke
in high spirits and ran quickly to brush his teeth in
the oasis pool. He felt so reckless that he swallowed
all his toothbrush water on purpose, a thing his
mother had told him particularly he should never
do. Then he gargled so loud that nobody could
hear the waterfall any more; so loud, in fact, that
the mules craned their heads around and looked
critically over their shoulders at him. Next he
caught sight of a group of melancholy waders,
some of them looking in the water for frogs and
some of them standing mournfully on one leg in
the shallows. So he crept along behind the bushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and then jumped out at them with such a shout
that he scared them into fits before they collected
themselves enough to spread their wings and fly
away.</p>

<p>His mother was not at all pleased at the way he
was going on. The sun was rising beyond the
tamarisk trees and a day&#8217;s travel lay before them,
so naturally she was not feeling in quite such a
sentimental mood as on the night before. She kept
darting black looks at him all the time she was
being saddled and packed, but she couldn&#8217;t get
near enough to him to say a word. He was dancing
foolishly around with his harp and making a spectacle
of himself before the mules, who, although
they did not usually see anything funny in anything,
had begun to show their teeth in quick unhappy
smiles.</p>

<p>And now the caravan started off again across the
sand, accompanied by the music of the camels&#8217;
silver bells. The young camel ran lightly along
beside his mother, humming under his breath
something about &#8220;love&#8221; and &#8220;the afternoon I met
you&#8221; and &#8220;a love nest for two,&#8221; which were words
from a song everybody was singing that year.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;The trouble with you is that you just can&#8217;t see
things as they really are,&#8221; his mother said severely
to him.</p>

<p>She reached out and tried to nip his ear, but he
skipped quickly behind her and there he began to
play with her tail, leaping and skidding, the way
a kitten will bound after his mother&#8217;s tail if he is
feeling full of milk and bold as brass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoops!&#8221; he cried, making another flying leap
after her tail as she tossed it in irritation into the
air. &#8220;And, anyhow, how <i>are</i> things <i>really</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd,&#8221; snapped his mother as she
ambled along behind the next camel&#8217;s hind legs
and tail. &#8220;Things <i>are</i> exactly as they <i>are</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun was rising higher above them, and
every instant it grew hotter until the heat seemed
to have bleached all the color out of the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, this sand is getting unbearably
hot,&#8221; his mother went on, &#8220;and there is no stopping
place until we reach the oasis, which will be
about sundown. Also, there is a sore on my right
hip which is being rubbed at every step by my
haunch strap. And, last but not least, you are behaving
like a perfect ninny. Such things <i>are</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Whether you like it or not, you have to admit
they&#8217;re <i>there</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is <i>there</i>?&#8221; asked the youngest camel
smartly, and his mother answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>There</i>, of course, means <i>here</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how <i>there</i> can be <i>here</i> when <i>there</i>&#8217;s
over there somewhere,&#8221; said her son, and she answered
shortly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste your time talking so ridiculously.
One of the things that doesn&#8217;t exist is the green
vale I had always hoped to settle in. At my time of
life I ought to have a place like that where I could
stretch out and eat all the fresh vegetation I
wanted and drink as much cool water as I
wanted&mdash;&#8221; The camel driver gave her mouth such
a jerk that she had to stop speaking for a moment,
and then she added bitterly: &#8220;That&#8217;s just one of
the things that can never possibly be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked the youngest camel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it can&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped his mother. &#8220;Because
your father didn&#8217;t take out any life insurance.
Because things <i>are</i> or else they <i>are not</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the caravan of white camels with
solid gold hoofs that goes right around the earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
like a belt?&#8221; asked the little camel, shifting his
harp on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooey,&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;A lot of hooey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a llama told me that back in Hindustan,&#8221;
her son insisted. &#8220;They go right around the world
through everything&mdash;cities, oceans, railway carriages,
skyscrapers. They keep on going all the
time and nothing can stop them and nobody except
camels can see them. And whenever a camel
is lost anywhere in the world he only has to join
the caravan of white camels and in the end he&#8217;s
bound to pass through his own country and find
his family again&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an ass,&#8221; said his mother. Her feet
were beginning to hurt her very much. &#8220;You can
be sure that&#8217;s one of the things that decidedly <i>is
not</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The llama said he knew a camel who&mdash;&#8221; he
began, but his mother interrupted:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Llamas are notoriously untruthful.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went on in silence for a while, but presently
the little camel began asking questions
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the two sides of the weather that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Mohammed has for a fan?&#8221; he said to his mother.
&#8220;The light blue side is turned towards him when
he feels like dancing and singing, and then the
dark side is turned out to us. And when he is in
thought he fans himself with the dark side so the
light won&#8217;t disturb him. That&#8217;s how we have good
and bad weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; snapped his mother. &#8220;Sometimes the
sun shines and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s all
there is to that story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the sun being a pineapple with its
skin taken off?&#8221; said the youngest camel rather
sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunkum!&#8221; said his mother as she ambled along
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The peacock I met in Kerbela said bad
weather came when the wind blew hard and broke
the pineapple off the branch and split it in five
hundred pieces,&#8221; the little camel said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a word of truth in that story
either,&#8221; his mother said. &#8220;You&#8217;re old enough
now,&#8221; she added as the camel driver jerked up her
nose, &#8220;to begin recognizing the truth when you
see it&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>But before she could say any more, the little
camel cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve found the most wonderful thing
you&#8217;ve ever seen! Oh, it&#8217;s so marvelous! I found
it&mdash;lying&mdash;right&mdash;here&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;sand&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Because his voice grew fainter and fainter, she
knew he must have stopped behind her to pick up
whatever it was, but when she tried walking slower
to give him time to catch up with her again, the
camel driver pulled fiercely at her reins. She could
not so much as turn her head to see what had become
of the youngest camel, but she had to go
loping on with that queer human-looking smile
on her lips which camels usually wear.</p>

<p>But they had not gone very far before she heard
her child panting behind her, and in another moment
he called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This time I&#8217;ve found a fortune! We&#8217;re going to
be rich and happy forever and you&#8217;ll never have to
work again! It&#8217;s a string of wonderful beads,&#8221; he
said, dropping into step behind her. &#8220;Some of
them are carved and they&#8217;re all different colors,
and they&#8217;re strung together on a solid-silver chain.
It must have been a prince who lost them on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
way to his wedding,&#8221; his excited voice went on.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they must be very valuable indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun was growing hotter and hotter in the
heavens, and now his mother, who was much older
than anyone would have believed, was feeling
more than a little impatient. She couldn&#8217;t crane
her neck around and see what the youngest camel
was up to, and her feet hurt her, and her hip was
rubbed quite raw.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, they don&#8217;t belong to you,&#8221;
she said to him in annoyance. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to turn
them over to the police as soon as we reach civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but look!&#8221; cried the little camel, just as if
it were possible for her to turn her head and see.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of paper tied to them. It says&mdash;let
me see a minute,&#8221; he said, as if trying hard to make
the letters out&mdash;&#8220;it says, &#8216;Whoever finds these
magic beads may keep them.&#8217; So you see!&#8221; he cried
out joyfully. &#8220;Now they belong to us and we can
sell them in the next city and you can have everything
you want to make you happy. You can have
a parasol to keep the sun off you, and a litter with
curtains at the sides to be carried in by slaves, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
you can wear a solid gold ring in your nose every
day, and I can have a big mirror to watch myself in
while I&#8217;m dancing, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what they look like,&#8221; said his mother,
beginning to be a little curious. &#8220;This brute is
holding the cord so tight that I can&#8217;t look around,
but describe them to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one is bright red,&#8221; said her son, following
quickly behind her. &#8220;The one next to it is
green, and the next after that shines like a diamond.&#8221;
He talked very slowly, as if he were examining
the necklace closely as he came along.
&#8220;And now I see something else!&#8221; he cried out in
fresh excitement. &#8220;Each one has a sort of message
written in it, carved right inside it in beautiful tiny
lettering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho,&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably
why they&#8217;re called magic beads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, that must be it. I hadn&#8217;t thought of
that,&#8221; said the youngest camel in an innocent-sounding
voice. &#8220;The jade one has written inside
it,&#8221; he went on slowly, as if he were having difficulty
in making out the words, &#8220;&#8216;I am the green
valley you long for. You may live in me forever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8217;
And the topaz bead says, &#8216;I am a silk tent to protect
you from sandstorms and from winter and from
the midday sun.&#8217; And the ruby one says, &#8216;I am
blood to flow in your veins and the veins of those
you love. Thus you may live forever.&#8217; And the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do any of them say anything about bones?&#8221;
asked his mother, and the little camel looked up
with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bones?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, bones,&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;Perhaps I
haven&#8217;t told you about that yet, but if you don&#8217;t
know it&#8217;s certainly high time you did. Although
we camels dread the smell or sight of death, there&#8217;s
really nothing nicer than being able to crunch the
bones of a fallen relative later, say three or four
months after his demise when the flesh has fallen
quite off his bones. They taste very good,&#8221; she
continued, almost smacking her lips. &#8220;Like pretzels
or salted almonds. It&#8217;s a great comfort if you&#8217;ve
lost someone dear to you to be able to munch him
up like that, and very good for the teeth and
hoofs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said the youngest camel, as if he had
been searching all this time for it and just found it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
in the string. &#8220;Here is a pure-white bead, like
ivory, and all around it there is written something
in gold. Yes&mdash;bones,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I do think
it says something about bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Read it quickly!&#8221; said his mother, and after a
moment of hesitation the little camel began reading
aloud very slowly and uncertainly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;If it&#8217;s bones you want,</div>
<div class="verse">No longer hunt.</div>
<div class="verse">Just rub my&mdash;rub my cheek</div>
<div class="verse">And bones will creak.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s really wonderful,&#8221; said his mother,
and now she had entirely forgotten about the heat
and how sore her hip was and how long a way
they had still to go. &#8220;I&#8217;m half tempted to have
you try it here, only it might be a bit embarrassing&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t try it now, would you?&#8221; cried
the little camel. &#8220;I think it would be much better
if we waited until this evening, because if bones
suddenly started creaking now the whole caravan
would stop and then they&#8217;d all see the beads
around my neck&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;But I can scarcely wait to try. Now, tell me what&#8217;s
written inside the diamond, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the diamond,&#8221; said her son slowly and
thoughtfully, exactly as if he were having a good
look for it among the other beads. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
rather difficult to make it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it would be very easy,&#8221; said the
mother camel. &#8220;It must be as clear as water, if it&#8217;s
a real diamond, so that you can see what&#8217;s written
in it without any trouble at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, the diamond takes the rays of
the sun on every one of its points,&#8221; said the little
camel, &#8220;and so it practically blinds me, it dazzles
so. But I think I can see something about &#8216;drink&#8217;
or &#8216;water&#8217; written in it. Oh, yes,&#8221; he went on presently,
during which time his mother concluded he
had been studying the jewel. &#8220;Oh, yes. Now I can
see. I&#8217;ve got in the shadow of your tail and I can
make out the words quite well. It says&mdash;let me
see&mdash;yes, it says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;When you would drink</div>
<div class="verse">Just cease to think</div>
<div class="verse">And bend your knee at my brink.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed his mother, joyfully,
and he could see by the way she ran youthfully
over the sand that she had completely forgotten all
her troubles and discomforts. So through the entire
blazing hot day, as they crossed the desert, he
told her one by one the endless colors and verses of
the beads. His little throat grew hoarser and
hoarser, and his tongue drier and drier from talking
so much, but the excited jerk of her shabby tail
before him was enough to urge him on and on. The
amethyst was the jewel of memory, he told her,
and you only had to hold it for a minute in your
ear for all the nice things that had happened in the
past to become the present. The moonstone was
the bead of the future, and after you had rubbed
it hard you could see reflected in it all that was
going to happen, and so you could avoid any coming
danger. The sapphire was the bead of purity,
and when you were old you need only press it for
an instant against your forehead to have all your
years drop from you like the petals from a flower.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the opal,&#8221; he ended, as the blue light of
evening began to fall. &#8220;It is the bead for those who
have told a lie. All you have to do is to hold it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
under your tongue for half an hour and the lie you
have told becomes the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there&#8217;s the oasis at last!&#8221; his mother cried
out. The youngest camel lowered his head and
peered through her legs, and there on the horizon,
which had not altered the entire day, he saw the
distant dark points which must be the oasis trees
growing. &#8220;The time passed very quickly, although
I was so impatient to see the necklace every minute,&#8221;
his mother said. &#8220;But now in no time at all
we can settle down and undo our packs and then
we can try the magic beads. The first one I&#8217;m
going to try is the sapphire, so I need not be old
any longer, and then the amethyst, so that all the
nice things that happened to me before will come
true again, and your father will be alive with us,
and then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the little camel said nothing
at all, but simply followed in her footsteps, and
once they had reached the green island in the vast
white sea of sand, the mother camel turned eagerly
to her son.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_022fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The little camel said nothing at all, but simply followed in<br />
her footsteps</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Quickly now, darling, come with me behind
the trees here and show me the necklace,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
whispered, and she hurried him off out of sight of
the others. But now that they were quite alone, the
youngest camel only hung his head. &#8220;Quickly,
quickly, where is it? I&#8217;ve never been so anxious to
see anything in my life&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said her child miserably, &#8220;there is no
necklace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she cried, tottering back under the
tamarisk trees. &#8220;Do you mean to say&mdash;oh, can it
be possible&mdash;oh, good heavens, it can&#8217;t be all a
lie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a lie or not,&#8221; said the little
camel, and he turned unhappily away from the
sight of her grief and fingered the tall grasses absent-mindedly.
&#8220;I made it up so you would forget
about the heat, so perhaps that isn&#8217;t quite so bad
as lying. I kept thinking perhaps the necklace was
really there, although I couldn&#8217;t see it, like the
caravan of white camels that girdles the earth, and
like Mohammed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is too much!&#8221; moaned his mother,
covering her face with her arms. &#8220;I never would
have thought you could&mdash;I never dreamed&mdash;oh
dear, oh dear&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;But music&#8217;s invisible, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said the little
camel in a gentle voice. &#8220;I kept on saying things
like that to myself to make the necklace seem all
right. I said, &#8216;Music&#8217;s invisible and history&#8217;s invisible
and memory&#8217;s invisible and love&#8217;s invisible
and still they&#8217;re all really there.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother had now sunk down on the ground
in despair, and realizing she was on the verge of
tears, her son took his harp off his shoulder and
shyly touched the strings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure if you&#8217;d feel like singing me to
sleep tonight,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;After all
that happened, I thought you might rather not. So
I made up the words of a lullaby myself, and if
you feel too badly I&#8217;ll sing them instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother was weeping now and she did not
answer, so he ran his fingers lightly over the strings
and began singing in a sad beautiful voice through
the night.</p>

<p>No sooner had he finished than two camel
drivers came to where they were seated under the
trees, and without speaking a word one of them
put a rope around the youngest camel&#8217;s neck. He
was so surprised that he simply stood there looking
at them in amazement, but his mother understood
at once what was taking place, and she raised
herself quickly from her knees and said to him in
a soft voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not resist them. Go quietly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>As they led him away, she hurried after him,
calling:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be brave, my son. Think of me and remember
all I have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>To stop the noise she was making, one of the
men turned and raised his whip and struck her
sharply on the soft part of her nose. She jumped
back with a little cry of pain, but long after they
had started out across the dark desert, the bewildered
little camel could hear her voice calling
and calling to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go quietly! Do not struggle! Do not forget me!
Perhaps one day we shall find each other again!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>



<h2 class="nobreak"><i>III</i></h2>


<p>THE TWO men led the youngest camel far, far
out into the desert, and after a long time, when
they seemed to be out of sight and hearing of any
living thing, they gave him the command to lie
down. He kneeled obediently before them, and
then they unwound the ropes from around their
waists and pushed him over on his side, and while
one camel driver sat on him, the other began
hastily to bind him. They drew his hind legs
roughly forward and knotted them tightly to his
forelegs, and he never dreamed of kicking or protesting.
He had been brought up to look on man
as master, for his mother had always told him this
was one of the unalterable truths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>So he lay there very meekly on one side and
allowed them to pass the ropes around his body
and draw them fast. He did not utter a sound, but
his heart was filled with fear. He was fastened so
firmly that he could scarcely breathe, and his
ankles seemed almost cut in half, but still he did
not think to struggle. When their work was done,
the camel drivers each gave him a parting kick or
two and then went off in the direction from which
they had come. He tried to raise his head a little
from the sand and with his eyes follow their retreat
through the starlit night. But after a moment
the two shapes muffled in their flowing robes were
lost in the darkness, and as the little camel realized
he was alone, he uttered one sudden terrible
scream.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_028fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>He lay there very meekly on one side</i></p>

<p>He had no intention of making a fuss or calling
a lot of attention to himself, but now he knew beyond
any doubt that this was the ordeal of loneliness
at last and he could not control the shaking
and the quaking and the sobs which shook his
frame. All about him lay the warm desert silence,
and there was no smell anywhere of other camels
or of man. He strained his ears until he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
they would fall from his head for some sound of
bells or perhaps the faintest echo of his mother&#8217;s
voice still calling out to him, but everything was
as quiet as the tomb.</p>

<p>After some time had passed like this, he began
kicking with all his strength. This was not such an
easy matter, either, because his feet were very
firmly tied. But he doubled up his legs as best he
could and then shot them savagely out. All this
served no purpose, however. In fact, it seemed to
draw the cords tighter and tighter around his neck
and shoulders and it certainly made the knots cut
deeper into his anklebones. So presently he gave
that up and tried lifting himself by pushing one
shoulder and one hip hard against the ground. But
this got him no further, and added to everything
else he had now got sand into both his eyes, and
his mouth was filled as well. In his misery, he
tried to remember all the things his mother had
told him as they lay under the oasis trees at night.
Once she had said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If a camel falls ill or is overcome with old age
while crossing the desert, the men unsaddle and
unload him and divide his pack among the others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and then he is abandoned. They leave him alone
there to die, kicking hour after hour against death,
while his friends are forced on, screaming aloud
with terror and despair and trying to look back
over their shoulders at him as they go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the truth is so terrible as all that,&#8221; he had
said to his mother, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why anyone pays
any attention to it. I think it would be much better
to make up something else instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>And another night his mother had said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If a camel does not have the smell of his own
kind about him, he is horribly frightened. But this
is such a foolish thing, if you really stop and think
about it, that wise camels have taught themselves
to master their fear.&#8221; And another time his mother
had said: &#8220;If we camels have silence in our ears,
that is another thing that drives us out of our
minds with fright. Perhaps that is the reason they
hang bells around our necks or perhaps that is
why you like to sing so loud at night when everything
is still.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remembering her words, the little camel began
to sing in a high quavering voice. He was in such
a state of nerves that he didn&#8217;t know what words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
he sang, and the tune kept changing from one
thing to another, and he couldn&#8217;t manage to keep
on the right key. But still he went on singing and
singing, making up songs about nothing lasting
forever, and about the swiftness of time passing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;All the time I am singing [was what he sang],</div>
<div class="verse">Time is passing, passing, passing.</div>
<div class="verse">The ordeal of loneliness will be over before I know it.</div>
<div class="verse">The camel drivers will come back and fetch me</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;ll run as fast as I can to Aqsu and find my mother&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But when he reached the word &#8220;mother&#8221; his
voice rose to a high wail and the tears rushed into
his eyes and down his cheeks. Very soon after this,
he must have cried himself to sleep, and when he
awoke the sun was already rising. He rolled his
eyes around in bewilderment a moment, and then
he felt the ropes fast on his legs and neck still and
the sand gritting in his teeth, and he knew where
he was and why he was there. As the sun rose, it
beat hotter and hotter on him and the sky seemed
to be on fire above him and the sand on fire underneath
him, and it is very probable that he became
delirious as noon approached.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>At one moment he thought he heard the faraway
tinkling of camel bells and he tried to call out,
but he could not. A little later, he thought he saw
pomegranate flowers and fruit hanging on cool
leafy branches before his eyes. Hour after hour
passed and he lay there gasping under the sun, and
at times he believed that icy pools of water were
just within reach, and at other times he thought
that fresh ripe figs were just about to melt on his
tongue. His eyes were glazing as his fever rose, and
his mind was filled with visions of strange and
beautiful things. With his parched black lips he
kept repeating:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Music&#8217;s invisible, memory&#8217;s invisible, love&#8217;s invisible,&#8221;
and in the same faint voice he whispered:
&#8220;Even hope&#8217;s invisible, but it must be there just
the same&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, he heard a gentle
sigh like a breeze stirring the air, and the next
instant a hand was laid on his forehead. He looked
up through the blinding waves of heat and he saw
a man standing beside him and leaning over to
stroke him, but strangely enough there was no
smell of man in his nostrils.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;This must be another vision,&#8221; he said to himself,
but at once the man began speaking to him
in a sweet musical voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting around for seventeen hours
for you to say that,&#8221; said the man, and for some
inexplicable reason he spoke a language which the
youngest camel understood with ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say what?&#8221; he murmured, and the man crossed
his legs under him and sat down on the sand. Then
he lifted the little camel&#8217;s head and laid it on his
silk-clad knees and stroked back his hair as a
mother might have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you to say the word
&#8216;hope,&#8217;&#8221; he answered, &#8220;because as soon as you
said that you proved you hadn&#8217;t given up, and
then I was able to become visible and rescue
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the little camel. He was
almost too weak to keep his eyes open now, but he
felt the man loosening the ropes that bound him
and this gave him courage to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m one of Mohammed&#8217;s sons,&#8221; the man
said casually. &#8220;I&#8217;m one of the youngest and not one
of the important ones. This year I&#8217;ve been given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
all the camels to keep an eye on. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m
here.&#8221; All the time he talked he kept undoing the
ropes and drawing them from under the little
camel&#8217;s hot body and shaking them off his ankles.
&#8220;If only you&#8217;d mentioned the word &#8216;hope&#8217; sooner
I could have let you free hours and hours ago.
You see, &#8216;hope&#8217; is the one word that lets me become
human for a little while and help camels
when they have been bound up like this by men.
I had to stick around here quite invisible until
you said that one particular word. One of the
laws is that I&#8217;m not allowed to make any suggestions,
no matter how much else I have to do. So
you can see what a lot of time I have to waste
just waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is the word &#8216;hope&#8217; magic?&#8221; asked the
youngest camel, stretching out one stiff leg to see
if it still could move. And now Mohammed&#8217;s son
lifted the little camel&#8217;s head up again and laid it
against his shoulder while he shook the remaining
cords away. When he did this, the little camel saw
that he was young and very handsome. He was
wearing a silk turban with pearls and turquoises
embroidered on it, and carved gold ornaments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
hung from his ears, and there was a look of great
gentleness in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, <i>h</i> stands for &#8216;help,&#8217; and <i>o</i> stands
for &#8216;O,&#8217; and <i>p</i> stands for &#8216;power,&#8217; and <i>e</i> stands for
&#8216;eternal,&#8217;&#8221; he said so lightly and merrily that he
seemed to be making fun of something. He took
out a little ivory flask from his garments and
poured some fresh water between the little camel&#8217;s
burning lips. &#8220;So when you say &#8216;hope&#8217; like that,
you&#8217;re really saying &#8216;Help, O power eternal!&#8217; And
that means me because I&#8217;ve been appointed your
patron saint this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The youngest camel was feeling so much better
by this time that, assisted by Mohammed&#8217;s son,
he was able to get to his knees and look around
him. But there was nothing at all to see as far as
the eye could reach but the empty sky and the
wastes of sand. Feeling a bit dizzy still, the little
camel looked up into the young man&#8217;s face and
tried to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t give you anything to eat,&#8221;
Mohammed&#8217;s son went on as he patted the little
camel&#8217;s cheek affectionately. &#8220;But it&#8217;s really too
difficult to travel around invisible with a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
mimosa branches and bones and things hanging
on me. But if you feel strong enough now, I can
start you off in the direction for Aqsu. I&#8217;m sure
you won&#8217;t have any trouble at all in finding your
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, don&#8217;t leave me alone! Please stay
with me until I find my mother and the caravan
again!&#8221; the youngest camel pleaded. But Mohammed&#8217;s
son shook his head at him and gently
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t run around after you like a nursemaid,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You see, there are lots and lots of other
young camels in just the same situation as you
were in when I came along, and I have to rescue
them too if it&#8217;s not too late. Only most of them
are so stupid or have been so obstinate about not
listening to what older camels say that I can&#8217;t do
anything for them. They just won&#8217;t use the word
&#8216;hope,&#8217; so I usually have to leave them there bound
up.&#8221; The little camel thought to himself that certainly
no one had ever been able to call him stupid
in his whole life, and he began to feel rather
pleased with himself again. &#8220;My father made a
rule,&#8221; Mohammed&#8217;s son went on, &#8220;that the guardian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of the camels could only bring help to those
whom men had tied up in knots; therefore, no
matter what happens to you, I won&#8217;t be able to
help you any further. But I&#8217;m sure nothing can
possibly happen to you now if you listen carefully
to my directions and do exactly what I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little camel was able to stand now and even
to walk without too much difficulty, and Mohammed&#8217;s
son led him a little farther into the desert.
All the time he talked lightly and happily to him
as they went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, the thing to keep in mind is that you
must follow the sun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you do that, and
run very fast, you will be in Aqsu just as night is
beginning to fall. Remember not to let the sun
show either over your right shoulder or over your
left, and don&#8217;t let the heat of the sun fall warm
on your tail. That will mean you are going in quite
the wrong direction. About twenty miles from
Aqsu you&#8217;ll come to a lovely oasis with hundreds of
herons bathing in the waters and flamingos flying
through the luxuriant glades. When you reach that
oasis, you will know for certain that you haven&#8217;t
much farther to go. If you do as I say,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
young man, stopping and putting one arm around
the youngest camel&#8217;s neck, &#8220;you can&#8217;t possibly
make a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little camel began to wonder if he had ever
in his entire life made a mistake, and he really
couldn&#8217;t think of a single time he had. But now
Mohammed&#8217;s son was saying farewell, and the
little camel cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you a thousand times! Thank you,
thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you must repeat after me the word which
restores me to godhead,&#8221; the young man said.
&#8220;For it is past time for me to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the word?&#8221; the youngest camel asked,
and the other replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pernod.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean? What does per&mdash;&#8221; the
little camel began, curiously, but Mohammed&#8217;s
son interrupted him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it or I&#8217;ll disappear at once and then
I won&#8217;t be able to tell you! <i>Pe</i> stands for &#8216;power
eternal&#8217; just as before, and <i>rnod</i> stands for &#8216;reign
near our dreams.&#8217; I never liked the word &#8216;reign&#8217;
much, but my father thought it added dignity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the formula so we let him have his way. So now repeat
it after me&mdash;<i>P-e-r-n-o-d</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please let me thank you again,&#8221; the little
camel said, &#8220;and, please, wouldn&#8217;t it be possible
for you to let my mother know that I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious,&#8221; said the young man, &#8220;you
mustn&#8217;t think about yourself all the time the way
you do! I have so much work to do I really haven&#8217;t
the time to rush around with personal messages
to camels&#8217; mothers&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the youngest camel, and this
time when Mohammed&#8217;s son smiled at him and
said the word he repeated it at once: &#8220;Pernod!&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the syllables had passed his lips, the
handsome youth waved his hand in farewell and
vanished from sight. Without wasting another
instant, the little camel turned his head towards
the sun and, his heart singing with hope in him,
began to run as fast as he possibly could across the
stretches of white desert in the direction of Aqsu.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="nobreak"><i>IV</i></h2>



<p>BY FOUR o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the little
camel was still running hard, but now he had
begun to slacken his pace a little, for it seemed to
him that some sort of object was appearing on
the horizon far, far away. Whatever it was, it was
decidedly to one side and not at all in the direction
of the sun where the handsome youth had told him
the oasis would be. As he ran he kept glancing out
of the corner of one eye at the dark object that
seemed to be growing bigger and bigger over his
left shoulder, and he kept asking himself what in
the world it could be.</p>

<p>After a while his curiosity got the best of him
and he stopped running entirely and turned halfway
around and gave the dark thing a good long
stare. And then he really began to suspect it was
the oasis. It looked exactly like an oasis. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
sure he could make out the tops of the trees against
the sky. It was certainly the oasis. In another
minute he had turned all the way around, and
even though he felt the light of the sun falling
warm on his tail, he was convinced it was the
oasis.</p>

<p>He thought he could even make out tiny black
specks hovering above it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are probably the herons and the flamingos,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;Mohammed&#8217;s son
said there were hundreds of them there.&#8221;</p>

<p>So without any further hesitation he started running
again, but this time in an entirely different
direction from the one in which Mohammed&#8217;s son
had told him he should go. Faster and faster he
sped towards the perfectly clear oasis ahead, and
now the sun was shining well over his right
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mohammed&#8217;s son certainly didn&#8217;t know what
he was talking about,&#8221; he said with a little snort
of laughter. &#8220;It&#8217;s evident even to an idiot that the
oasis is over there right in front of me and not in
the direction of the sun in the slightest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In half an hour at the most, he thought, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
would be snuggling down against his mother
among the fresh grasses of the oasis twenty miles
this side of Aqsu. He knew he was absolutely right
and he began complimenting himself on his quick
eyes and wits. Most young camels would have
gone right on and never noticed what fools they
were making of themselves, he thought with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It just shows,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;that it
doesn&#8217;t pay to believe everything you&#8217;re told.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so pleased with himself that he began
to whistle as he ran. He whistled treble and bass
and, by curling his tongue up against his lower
teeth, managed to do some double-stops. And now
that he made out what looked exactly like branches
of palm trees waving against the sky ahead, he gave
a few little hops and skips of joy.</p>

<p>Before he had gone much farther a flock of
herons came flying across the heavens towards him,
and as they came near to him they circled lower,
so low in fact that he could see their long legs
dangling in the air behind them as they flew. The
sight of such a baby camel running so fast and
quite alone across the sands made them circle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
closer and closer above him in wonder, and at last
the leader of the herons called down:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going so fast, four-footed child?&#8221;</p>

<p>The youngest camel was a bit annoyed at being
called a child by birds he had never laid eyes on
before, and he tossed his head rather insolently as
he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to the oasis which my mother is
passing through with her caravan. If they&#8217;ve started
on by the time I get there, I&#8217;ll run straight on to
Aqsu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lost your way, four-footed child!&#8221; the
herons called down in chorus. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to the
oasis for the night. Watch us and follow where
we go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can see the oasis as clear as day ahead!&#8221;
the little camel cried out impatiently. &#8220;You must
be blind as bats, old birds! Can&#8217;t you see the palms
and the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lost your way!&#8221; the leader of the herons
called down to him again as she swept above him
and beckoned with one wing. But the youngest
camel went running on in his own direction as fast
as he could go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;re just as stupid as I always thought,&#8221;
said the little camel to himself. &#8220;They can&#8217;t see
two inches in front of their big beaks, the silly-looking
creatures!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flock of them swerved over him once more,
calling to him to come, and then they flew off,
their legs floating on the air behind them. He
glanced around to watch them go, and in a few
moments they were nothing but tiny specks against
the sky, and presently they were lost completely
in the sun&#8217;s dying light. When the little camel
looked back at the oasis again, he saw to his surprise
that for some reason it was not a bit nearer
than it had been before. He could see the palms
clearly enough, and the birdlike shapes hovering
above, but he certainly was no closer to it, though
all the time he had been running fast.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_044fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>And then they flew off, their legs floating on the air behind them</i></p>

<p>His legs were beginning to feel tired now, and
his feet hot and sore, and he suddenly felt angry
with everyone and everything. He kicked viciously
at the sand as he ran, and after another little while,
as if he must put the blame on someone, he looked
back over his right shoulder and stuck out his
tongue and wrinkled his nose up at the sun. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
whole world was turning pink now at the end of
day, and the wide desert was glowing with the
sun&#8217;s last light. There was the oasis still, not so
very far away, and yet mysteriously just as far as
it had ever been.</p>

<p>As the youngest camel went running on in discouragement,
a flock of flamingos came winging
towards him, their feathers and their legs colored
like the petals of a rose. When they saw such a
baby camel running so desperately across the
wastes of sand, they circled several times above
him, their legs hanging down like brilliant satin
ribbons, and the leader called down:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going so fast, four-footed child?&#8221;
and he answered in irritation:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you have to ask such a stupid
question! Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m going to the oasis?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was so tired now that he stopped running
while he talked to them, and stood stamping
his foot in the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have lost your way, four-footed child!&#8221;
the flamingos all called out to him in chorus. &#8220;We
are going to the oasis! Follow us and we will show
you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>They wheeled once above him, calling out to
him to follow, and then they flapped slowly off in
the direction of the setting sun. He stood looking
after them rather wistfully for a moment, and
then he tossed his head and turned back towards
the oasis. It seemed to him now to be even farther
away than ever, and tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>sure</i> I couldn&#8217;t have made a mistake,&#8221; he
said stubbornly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I couldn&#8217;t be wrong.
It&#8217;s absolutely impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in the world should that be impossible?&#8221;
asked a clear little trilling voice very close to his
ear, and when he looked quickly around him he
saw that scores of brightly feathered little birds
were flying and darting in the air about his head.
From the feeling of it, some of them had certainly
alighted on his hump and some on the back of his
neck, and there they were all chattering and chirping
together. The bird who had spoken to him
was no bigger than a pear leaf, but its feathers
were brighter than a peacock&#8217;s. In company with
others just like it, it spun and darted on the air
before him, humming and whistling and eying him
sharply and curiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t made any mistakes yet in my life,&#8221;
he said boldly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a single time I&#8217;ve
been wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, all the little birds uttered tiny shrieks
of laughter and swayed back and forth on their
perches on his spinal column and on his neck and
on the top of his head. To his annoyance he realized
that some of them were swinging and shrieking
with laughter on his tail, and he thrashed it
angrily from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re so smart and know so much
about me,&#8221; he said furiously, &#8220;tell me once when
I&#8217;ve done something I shouldn&#8217;t! I&#8217;m sure you can&#8217;t
think of a single time. I know I&#8217;m a very good
singer because everyone I ever met said I was, and
I&#8217;m a very good poet and I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good heavens!&#8221; screamed the dozens and
dozens of little birds all together, and their shrill
laughter trilled and whistled all around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing at all to laugh at!&#8221; the youngest
camel cried out, stamping his foot. &#8220;I&#8217;m simply
telling you the truth&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my goodness!&#8221; shrieked all the birds
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;You speaking the truth!&#8221; cried the first little
bird as she cavorted on the air before him, and all
the birds&#8217; tongues tinkled like little bells with
laughter. &#8220;Do you remember the terrible lie you
told your mother about finding the necklace?&#8221;</p>

<p>Either the very last crimson rays of the sun on
him or his own conscience turned the little camel&#8217;s
face bright red and he hung his head between his
legs and looked hard at the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve always made the mistake of being conceited,&#8221;
one clear sweet bird&#8217;s voice sang to him,
and immediately the other voices went on with it,
one by one, as if it were so many verses of the same
song they were singing as they fluttered about him
in the evening air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always made the mistake of not believing
what your mother told you,&#8221; rippled the notes
from one feathered throat, and the next one
sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always bullied creatures smaller than yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were wrong not to do what Mohammed&#8217;s
son told you,&#8221; whistled another, and still another
trilled:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;You were always a coward except when you
were with your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were so pleased with yourself you wouldn&#8217;t
listen to the herons,&#8221; sang the next, and one,
swinging far back on the youngest camel&#8217;s tail,
chirped:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have always been the most conceited camel
on the desert,&#8221; and another sang clearly to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You made the mistake of insulting the flamingos
when they tried to help you! Now they&#8217;re
your enemies for life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I could see the oasis right before me all
the time!&#8221; the little camel cried out, by this time
very near to tears. &#8220;It&#8217;s so plain anybody can see
it if they simply look&mdash;&#8221; He swung around to
point out to them the far waving palms and the
birds hovering over the trees against the horizon
ahead, and then he stopped short and stared in
amazement, for nowhere in sight was there any
sign of anything at all. &#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;what&#8217;s happened&mdash;but&mdash;there
was&mdash;but&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand&mdash;&#8221;
he stammered, and with a loud sweet
trill of laughter the scores of bright small birds
took wing from his back and his tail and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
crown of his head and the tips of his ears and
paused a moment with a rush of wings above
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any oasis!&#8221; one shrill musical
bird voice called down to him, and all the other
voices sang in chorus together:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw a mirage! A mirage! You saw a
mirage!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lost!&#8221; cried the first bird&#8217;s clear little
voice. &#8220;You thought you knew better than anyone
else, and now you&#8217;re lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all gave another burst of laughter, and
then they called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mirage, a mirage! You saw a mirage!&#8221;</p>

<p>In another instant, the flock of them had risen
straight above him and vanished into nothing in
the graying sky.</p>

<p>Now that the youngest camel found himself
alone in the falling night, he sank down upon his
knees in despair. He laid his quivering chin upon
his forelegs and sobs shook his bowed little shoulders.
He was alone, he was lost, with nothing to
eat or drink and not even his harp to comfort him.
Which way Aqsu lay he no longer knew, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
his grief he believed that he would never find his
mother or any other living thing again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope, hope, where are you?&#8221; he cried out in
desperation. But he knew that magic word was
powerless now to bring Mohammed&#8217;s son to his
side. As complete darkness fell around him, his
terror grew and he rose to his feet again and
stumbled blindly on. &#8220;Oh, why, why did I let the
sun fall warm on my tail?&#8221; he wept aloud. &#8220;It was
just what he told me not to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>DURING THAT night the youngest camel must
have dropped in his tracks and fallen asleep from
sheer exhaustion, for the next thing he knew the
sun was shining on his face again. He jumped to
his feet quickly in the early day and, as if his life
depended on it, he began running towards the
rising sun. But in a moment he stopped short,
saying to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t in the morning when Mohammed&#8217;s
son said I should run straight in the direction
of the sun&#8217;s face. Perhaps that makes a difference.
Perhaps I should run with the sun behind
me now if I want to find my way to the oasis.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he turned around and began running as fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
as he could in the opposite direction, thinking to
himself that everything would surely be all right
now. All he need do was to run away from the
sun until the noon hour came and it was exactly
in the middle of the sky, and then as it came down
the other side he would race straight towards it,
and perhaps he wouldn&#8217;t be too late to catch up
his mother and the caravan if they had taken their
time about setting out from Aqsu. He was feeling
quite comforted by these thoughts, and at the same
time he was trying very hard not to feel too self-satisfied
because he had worked out the movements
of the sun without any help from anyone older
and wiser than himself. He was hungry and he
wanted a drink very badly, but somehow he was
filled with new hope and courage now that another
day had dawned.</p>

<p>He kept up his pace for an hour or more without
seeing any sign of life either on earth or in the
sky, and there was no doubt that he did not mind
the nothingness and the loneliness nearly as much
as he had the day before. With every step he took,
he felt a little bit braver and a little bit surer that
he was going in the right direction at last. So when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
he saw two black shapes on the desert far ahead,
he said to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;re nice friendly sort of creatures
who will tell me how many miles the oasis
lies ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>On he went with eager, flying feet, and soon he
saw that the two black forms were those of birds.
Two enormous birds were apparently seated on
the sand having a conversation together, their
backs turned to him and their heads nodding and
shaking as they talked. But as he came nearer, he
ran less quickly towards them, for he saw their
heads were bald as ostrich eggs and reddish in
color, and that they were not conversing at all but
tearing fiercely with their curved beaks and their
great claws at something they held between them
on the sand.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_054fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>It&#8217;s much wiser to be polite to everyone I meet, because one<br />
never knows.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vultures!&#8221; thought the youngest camel, and a
little tremor of fear went through him, for his
mother had told him stories enough of how these
creatures lived. He was about to turn to one side
and make a curve to avoid them, but then he remembered
all that the bright-feathered, sharp-tongued
little birds had said to him the night before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s much wiser to be polite to everyone I
meet, because one never knows,&#8221; he said to himself,
and he stepped a little closer to them. &#8220;Please,&#8221;
he began in a timid voice, and both vultures were
so startled by the sound that they each gave a
squawk and jumped a full yard into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snakes alive!&#8221; cried one bird as she came down
on the sand again and with the claws of one foot
seized upon the thing they had been eating. &#8220;You
ought to give some warning instead of creeping up
on people like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you must have seen me long ago,&#8221;
said the youngest camel apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said the second vulture. &#8220;We came
down to finish eating this hare in peace and quiet
and we had no idea anyone was spying on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she said this, she snatched up in her vicious
claws the other end of what was left of the hare
and started tearing at it with her beak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to spy,&#8221; said the little camel.
&#8220;I just wanted to ask you if I am going in the right
direction for the oasis and Aqsu.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he said this, both birds stopped fighting
over their prey and looked at him with interest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;Are you lost?&#8221; asked the first one in a sharp,
rather eager voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m afraid I am,&#8221; said the little camel.
&#8220;But I think by running ahead of the sun until
noon and then running towards it all afternoon
I&#8217;m sure to come to the oasis in the end. At least,
Mohammed&#8217;s son told me yesterday to keep the
sun straight before me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but yesterday was yesterday,&#8221; said the first
vulture with a giggle as she gave her sister a sly
glance. &#8220;Today is today, so of course everything is
quite different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how the sun can be any different,&#8221;
said the youngest camel. &#8220;The sun always follows
exactly the same course, so all I have to do is follow
the sun as soon as it is past the noon hour&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where in the world did you learn that the sun
always follows the same course?&#8221; cried the second
vulture. &#8220;There&#8217;s an idea for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it never does the same thing twice,&#8221; said
the other vulture, still giggling behind her wing.
&#8220;Some days it runs all over the place, getting behind
clouds and hiding behind mountains. Yesterday
it was going from north to south, just for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the fun of it, and today, as you can see for yourself,
it&#8217;s going from east to west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t imagine you can count on the sun!&#8221; said
the second sister with great contempt, and she
went back to pulling and tugging at the remains
of the hare.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might just as well become acquainted with
us now,&#8221; said the first vulture, seizing on one of
the best bits for herself. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Annie and
my sister&#8217;s name is Mabel, and if you&#8217;re really lost
you&#8217;ll come to know us very well indeed in the
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am lost,&#8221; said the youngest camel, looking
from one to the other of their faces. &#8220;I thought
perhaps you&#8217;d be kind enough to tell me which
way the oasis lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say he&#8217;s quite truthful,&#8221; said Annie with
a gulp as she swallowed the dead hare&#8217;s fuzzy tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t always been,&#8221; said the youngest
camel, &#8220;but I think I&#8217;ve learned my lesson now
and I&#8217;m trying very hard not to lie any more. But
now that you tell me the sun isn&#8217;t going the same
way today as it did yesterday, I simply don&#8217;t know
what to do&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;It would have been better for your sake if you
hadn&#8217;t told the truth this time,&#8221; said Mabel, ignoring
his last remark. Then she turned back to the
business before them and began slicing the hare&#8217;s
heart into neat roast-beef-like portions with her
beak.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked the youngest camel, rather
disgusted at the way the two sisters grabbed and
squawked over their meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as long as you&#8217;re lost,&#8221; said Annie, &#8220;then
you can&#8217;t find the oasis, and if you can&#8217;t find the
oasis then you&#8217;re sure to die in another two or three
days&mdash;&#8221; She paused to pick her teeth reflectively
with the yellow claw of one foot. &#8220;You&#8217;re small but
you&#8217;re rather well covered with meat,&#8221; she said in
a moment, and at this the two sisters looked at each
other and cackled out loud.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the poor little camel realized what
their conversation was all about and he gave a
scream of terror. He reared up on his hind legs
with fright and spun around, and set off as fast as
he could across the desert. He had no idea which
way he was going and it didn&#8217;t matter much any
more whether he was lost or not. He only knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
he must get out of sight of the two bald sisters,
and out of the sound of their chortling laughter.
So he ran at full speed until the midday sun beat
down on his head like fire, and then he slowed into
a walk. He hoped that walking quietly along
would make his heart stop beating so fast and loud
with fear, and he tried making up some rhymed
poetry so as to steady his nerves. But nothing
sounded right to him, neither the sonnet form, nor
rondos, nor madrigals, nor pastorals, nor odes. The
laments and ballads and elegies were even less successful,
so in despair he decided on just trying to
write a letter to his mother in verse, but he couldn&#8217;t
think of a single original or even beautiful line.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Dear Mother [he began], how in the world am I going to get on without you?</div>
<div class="verse">I miss your hump and your sore hip and everything about you.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just plain statement of fact. That isn&#8217;t
poetry,&#8221; he interrupted himself severely. &#8220;Now see
if you can&#8217;t think of something really lyrical the
way you used to at the oasis at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the silly, everyday sort of letter went on:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a fool of myself with every bird that flies</div>
<div class="verse">And with Mohammed&#8217;s son, and I&#8217;ve told so many lies.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But he couldn&#8217;t help adding at the end:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;One or two things I&#8217;ve said are true:</div>
<div class="verse">History, Music, Memory,</div>
<div class="verse">Are still the invisible three,</div>
<div class="verse">And Love, invisible it&#8217;s true,</div>
<div class="verse">Still has the shape and smell of you.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t at all satisfied with this, and even
when he had repeated it over two or three times to
himself and once out loud he did not feel the glow
of pride which usually suffused his being after he
had composed a poem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it might be better if I tried putting it
to music,&#8221; he said. But the fact that he did not have
his harp with him made the biggest difference, and
now when he opened his lips to sing, nothing but
a hoarse whisper came from his mouth. By this
time, he knew beyond any shadow of doubt that
he was neither a poet nor a singer, and he swallowed
his pride and said bravely to himself: &#8220;Very
well, then. Now I have found out the truth about
myself. It&#8217;s time I did. I cannot write poetry and
I cannot sing, but perhaps I can dance.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>He remembered the foolish poem he had made
up about dancing for the Shah and the Lamas and
the Raj with a tambourine tied to his tail, and
now he tried to execute a few dance steps across
the burning sand. But he only tottered awkwardly
from side to side, and if he hadn&#8217;t stopped at once
he would certainly have toppled over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a camel without any gifts of any kind,&#8221; he
told himself in a stern voice. &#8220;Everything I have
believed about myself has been blind, empty
vanity. I have no talent as a poet, nor as a singer,
nor as a dancer, and now that I am much too weak
to carry a load and walk in a caravan with other
camels, I am no good to anyone on earth and I
might as well be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed this might very easily have been the end
of the youngest camel, for there seemed no reason
at all why he should not have sunk down there under
the blistering heat and quietly breathed his
last. And in another day or two Annie and Mabel
would have come flapping along and smiled sideways
at each other as they wheeled above him, and
after circling over him a few times they would
have descended and begun their meal. Only this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
isn&#8217;t at all what happened, for now that the little
camel admitted that he no longer thought his own
voice so beautiful and his own poetry so fine, and
no longer longed for a full-length mirror so that
he could see how lovely he looked while he danced,
he seemed to be able to hear other voices which
he had never dreamed existed. The air that passed
his ears seemed now to have the power of speech,
and as he walked he listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is an oasis in every camel&#8217;s desert of
despair,&#8221; said one particle of air to him, and another
murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be far now, for you have come a long
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a stiff upper hump,&#8221; said the soft warm
air in his ears. &#8220;Be armed with patience, lamblike,
quiet as a mouse, cool as a cucumber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said the youngest camel meekly, although
he was feeling very hot.</p>

<p>Even the sand under his feet seemed to be endowed
with speech now, for as it ran through his
hoofs he heard it whispering:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind is coming, the wind is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind is coming,&#8221; murmured one grain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
sand to another all over the desert, and the others
whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a little while we shall have to rise and
dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the little camel had gone much farther,
he saw a white cloud of wind advancing rapidly
across the clear blue sky, and in another minute he
heard it wailing:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am, ow-oooo-ow&mdash;oooooo! Here is your
master, ow-ooo! Arise, slaves! A-r-i-i-i-i-se!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here and there across the desert the sand began
to rise in spirals, whirling and turning and swaying
its arms in the frantic dance. Wild, ghost-like
figures of sand spun up around the youngest
camel, reaching taller and taller above him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dance! Dance!&#8221; screamed the wind as he lashed
them, and in an instant the little camel was almost
blinded by the gritty veils which were flung
into his eyes. Nothing could he see to the east or
the west or the north or the south except the
dervish-like white figures which spun around him.
The sun seemed to have been blown from the sky,
and the gray of twilight closed upon them. As the
little camel staggered blindly on through the swirling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
skirts of flying sand, he heard the voices speaking
secretly in his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Close your eyes,&#8221; whispered one sand dervish
as the wind thrust her fiercely upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Close your lips,&#8221; said another as the wind blew
her savagely against the little camel&#8217;s tender nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not breathe deeply,&#8221; whispered a third, and
still another murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not struggle. You will only wear yourself
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The force of the wind had blown every thought
from his head, and now he closed his eyes and his
lips as the sand dervishes had bade him and he let
himself be guided by their gentle hands. How
many hours passed like this he never knew. All
around him spun the tireless dancers, torn this
way and that by the wind&#8217;s screaming fury, and
when they came near they whispered words of
hope and courage to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you find the pathway between the winds,
you will be saved,&#8221; one sand dervish murmured
in his ear, and another one whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe in us. We will show you the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>All through that afternoon, perhaps, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
through the night that followed, the youngest
camel staggered blind and spent through the storm.
But now there seemed to be no longer any division
of time, no night or day, no sun or moon, no
heat or cold. But finally, when he thought he could
go no farther, the voice of a sand dervish whispered
to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we have brought you to the pathway between
the winds. Go quietly ahead. Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost at once the gale&#8217;s force grew less and
less about him and the screams of the wind grew
fainter and fainter until there was nothing to be
heard except a last long parting wail. Then a perfect
calmness fell upon the earth and air around
the little camel, and in another moment he ventured
to open his eyes. And there he stood blinking
in bewilderment, for he saw he was no longer
on the desert, nor was there any sign of sand or a
distant horizon to be seen. His feet lay on a carpet
of fresh green grasses, and a little rivulet ran chattering
through the rocks beside him. All about
stood luxuriant fruit trees with their boughs laden,
and through their thick foliage he saw the sun was
rising. Delicate birds with bright exotic plumage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
winged from branch to branch above his head,
and shy wood animals moved swiftly in the glades.</p>

<p>Now that his eyes grew accustomed to these unexpected
wonders, he saw that a few steps before
him, just at the edge of the wood, a silk tent was
pitched. Its brocaded doors were caught back with
brooches of shining stones and a thin thread of
incense smoke was drawn languidly upward from
its opening onto the quiet air. The youngest
camel looked in amazement about him, and then
he fell joyfully on his knees at the stream&#8217;s brink
and lowered his head toward the cool running
water. But before he had time to drink, a rather
lazy, indolent voice called out to him from inside
the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, not so fast, young camel. Listen
first to what I have to say. You have passed through
the third and last night of your ordeal of loneliness,&#8221;
it said, &#8220;but the third day is just dawning.
Twelve hours lie ahead of you before you may
safely eat or drink. The day which is just being
born is the Day of Temptation. Some camels consider
it the most difficult day of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>If anyone had said this to the little camel the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
week before, he would have paid no attention at
all, but would have gone right ahead and drunk
his fill at the brook. Then he would have jumped
up and run to the big trees and started pulling the
fruit hungrily down from the heavily laden boughs.
But so much had happened to him in the past two
days that now he rose obediently without so much
as wetting his parched lips, and turned respectfully
towards the beautiful silk tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must say you&#8217;ve saved yourself a lot of
trouble,&#8221; the voice went on, and the youngest
camel stood listening to it with lowered head. &#8220;If
you hadn&#8217;t done what I told you, all this would
have vanished in the twinkling of an eye and you
would be right back in the middle of the sandstorm
again and this time the sand dervishes would
never have helped you to get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the storm was over, master,&#8221; said
the little camel, not daring to lift his eyes towards
the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it never stops,&#8221; the lazy voice went on.
&#8220;It&#8217;s always there for other camels to get lost in
the way you did. It&#8217;s always blowing just as hard as
when you were in it, only you can&#8217;t hear it any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
more because the sand dervishes showed you the
pathway between the winds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were they so kind as to help me, O
master?&#8221; asked the little camel respectfully, and
the sleepy voice answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably because you admitted in that poem
you made up yesterday that you were really very
conceited and had made a fool of yourself with
everybody you met. The herons and the flamingos
gave a very bad report on you, but apparently you
got a little more sensible later. If you manage to
get through today without being childish, you
ought to be having a nice champagne supper somewhere
with your mother this evening.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_068fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The little camel took another uncertain step towards the tent</i></p>

<p>The youngest camel felt a tremor of joy go
through him at these words, and he felt himself
strong enough now to resist any temptation that
might come along. He almost jumped straight up
into the air with delight, but his knees were so
weak under him from lack of food and weariness
that he decided not to make any unnecessary movements.
Instead he called out in an enraptured
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know I can get through today all right!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
I&#8217;m absolutely certain I&#8217;ll do everything the way I
should!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; said the
voice, and it sounded now as if its owner were
stifling a yawn. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t start out by being so
sure of anything. Come in and pay reverence to me
and I&#8217;ll explain things to you more fully. Come
along in, don&#8217;t be bashful,&#8221; it said as the little
camel hesitated and teetered on one foot near the
open door. &#8220;All you have to do is pay homage to
me and then you have nothing to fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little camel took another uncertain step
towards the tent, and then he halted again and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t know how to pay
homage. You see, nobody ever taught me how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just bow down a few times and strike your
forehead once or twice on the floor, and kiss my
big toe if you feel like it,&#8221; said the sleepy voice.
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really matter what you do as long as you
feel inferior to me inside. It&#8217;s just part of the rigamarole
and the sooner you get it over with the better.
Some camels are so arrogant they absolutely
refuse to do it, and then it&#8217;s really such a bore for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
everybody. They have to go right back to Annie
and Mabel and be torn to pieces for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he heard this, the little camel made haste
to enter the tent, and there he fell promptly on
his knees and struck his forehead three times on
the richly carpeted floor. After he had done this,
he advanced with lowered head to embrace the
unknown person&#8217;s toe. The smell of incense was
strong and sweet on the air, and when his eyes had
become accustomed to the dim light he saw that
it was a spotlessly clean gold hoof he kissed. He
glanced quickly up and looked shyly and curiously
at the owner of it, and lo! it was an enormously
fat and incredibly ancient camel with a coat as
white as snow.</p>

<p>The great kingly camel was lolling back on a
divan covered with silk cushions of every color
of the rainbow, and with one hand he lazily fanned
himself with a soft peacock-feather fan. A necklace
of opals as big as alligator eggs hung around his
shoulders, and elaborate earrings of opals and tiny
bright diamonds studded his hairy ears. But it was
his eyes which held the youngest camel entranced&mdash;they
were big and brown, and heavy lids hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
over them like white velvet curtains. Every time
the white velvet curtains seemed about to close
completely over his eyes, the old camel would snap
them up again, and then slowly, sleepily, they
again began falling, until the final moment when
he jerked them back. This happened several times
before he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up,&#8221; he said with a yawn. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
have to overdo it. It&#8217;s just as bad to be too humble
as it is to be too self-satisfied. There&#8217;s certainly
no need to call me master, although I don&#8217;t mind
at all your revering and worshiping me.&#8221; He leaned
up on one elbow, slowly fanning himself, and examined
the youngest camel. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be
bad-looking if you learned how to carry yourself
better,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;You let your head hang
down as if you were ashamed of something, and
you have a rather silly smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the little camel, standing contritely
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it doesn&#8217;t really make any difference,&#8221; said
the white camel dreamily, and he raised his fan to
hide his yawn behind the peacock feathers. &#8220;Everyone
has different ideas about things. Men try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
make their children sit up straight so they won&#8217;t
have humps on their backs and mother camels do
all they can to make their children hump themselves
for fear their backs will turn out straight.
It&#8217;s just a matter of preference. But now you
mustn&#8217;t keep us dawdling here any longer, for it&#8217;s
getting late and we must set out on our journey.
Oh, in case you didn&#8217;t recognize me,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;I&#8217;m the leader of the caravan of white camels
that circles the earth and we must be getting
started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my mother told me the caravan of white
camels didn&#8217;t exist!&#8221; exclaimed the youngest camel
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we exist,&#8221; said the white leader, and
instead of making any move towards rising he sank
farther back into his cushions and gave a tremendous
yawn. &#8220;Everything exists somehow, either in
the imagination or really or only at night or
simply in the daytime.&#8221; His lids sank so low over
his eyes now that the little camel thought the great
white leader had finally fallen asleep. But just at
the last moment he jerked them up again and went
on talking. &#8220;What was I saying? Oh, yes. Now, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
mustn&#8217;t hold us up any longer, for we really have
to get started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked the young camel
respectfully when he saw the white leader was
making no move to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nowhere in particular,&#8221; the old camel
answered. &#8220;We just go round and round and try
to make you give in to one temptation after another.
It&#8217;s not at all amusing for us because we
have to go through it so often. You&#8217;re the only one
who gets any fun out of it because it&#8217;s all new to
you. Only if you give in to a single temptation,
that&#8217;s the end. You have to go all the way back to
the first night when the camel drivers tied you
out in the desert, and once you&#8217;re out there bound
up again you die of fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old camel gave such a terrific yawn at this
that his servants must have thought they were being
called, for at the sound of it two sleek white
camels with brocaded bands around their shoulders
came in through the door of the tent and kneeled
before their leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, closing his fan. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
going.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Immediately the two servants rose and slipped
their bands under the two ends of the old camel&#8217;s
divan and lifted him, cushions and all, and bore
him out of the tent into the light of the softly
dawning day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate getting up so early,&#8221; said the old white
camel as he adjusted the cushions behind his head
with one lifted arm. The youngest camel trotted
along beside him and respectfully nodded his head.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak frankly to me?&#8221; the old
camel asked him dreamily. &#8220;You were thinking I
wasn&#8217;t at all up, weren&#8217;t you? You felt like saying
that I was really more down, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted the little camel. &#8220;I was thinking
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as he had said this, he saw that a beautiful
pure-white camel had suddenly appeared behind
them and was following close behind the
litter on which the drowsy leader stretched at his
ease. His hoofs, too, were of finest gold and he
wore a halter of spun gold. When the old camel
saw the youngest camel staring with admiration at
the new arrival, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Fourteen Carat. He&#8217;s the first always to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
join the caravan and that means you&#8217;ve passed
safely through one temptation.&#8221; They were moving
out from under the green trees now onto the
desert sands. &#8220;Of course, you were tempted to lie
when I asked you what you were thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just for politeness&#8217; sake,&#8221; said the youngest
camel, contritely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, most camels do lie when I ask them that,
so as not to hurt my feelings,&#8221; the old white leader
said. &#8220;And then it&#8217;s the end of them. They simply
vanish into thin air, like a puff of smoke. Every
time you resist a temptation,&#8221; he went on, trying
hard not to yawn, &#8220;you&#8217;ll notice that another
camel joins our caravan.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>VI</i></h2>



<p>SO, HOUR after hour as they traveled across the
desert, the ordeal of temptation went on.</p>

<p>After the temptation to tell a lie for politeness&#8217;
sake came the temptation to rest by reclining on
the beautiful litter which camels brought and set
down before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might as well take it easy the way I&#8217;m
doing,&#8221; said the old white camel. &#8220;My servants are
quite used to carrying people, and if you rest now
you won&#8217;t be nearly so tired at the end of the day.
We have a long, long journey before us and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, thank you!&#8221; said the youngest camel.
&#8220;I&#8217;m quite used to walking by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And no sooner were the words out of his mouth
than he saw a second white camel spring up behind
Fourteen Carat and join the caravan. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
came the temptation to crunch the bones which
were served on platters within an inch of his nose;
and then the temptation to drink from the copper
basins which they carried to him filled with sparkling
water and lemonade, but all this he resisted.
Then the white leader reached indolently up from
his litter as they jogged along, and drew down the
weather and showed the little camel that it was
actually a fan with two sides to it. One side was
good weather and the other was bad, and he
strongly advised the little camel to accept it as a
gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the little camel. &#8220;Thank you very
much, but I think I&#8217;d better not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very silly if you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said the old
white leader, opening the fan to show him how
nice it was. &#8220;Think how useful it would be to
your mother. You could take it to her as a present
this evening, and from then on she could always
have exactly the kind of weather she wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little camel considered seriously for a moment,
and the desire to take it grew stronger and
stronger as the white leader went on talking to
him in a slow, dreamy voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Your mother would never be too cold or too
hot ever again,&#8221; he was saying to him. &#8220;She
wouldn&#8217;t have to get drenched by storms any more
or covered with snow on the steppes during the
bad season. I can&#8217;t imagine why you hesitate like
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at last the little camel made a great effort
and he set his fuzzy chin firmly and replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, I don&#8217;t think I will after all.
But thank you just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as soon as he had said this, another snow-white
camel sprang up in the caravan.</p>

<p>Next came the temptation to flee before a great
wall of fire which rose suddenly before them, but
this too he resisted, and as he passed through it
with his eyes tightly closed he did not even feel its
heat; and then the temptation to cry out with
fright and swoon at the sight of three dead llamas
stretched out on the lonely sands; and then the
temptation to sob aloud when the old camel spoke
for a long time to him about his mother, and how
hard she had worked all her life, and how tired she
was of carrying the burdens of men. But all these
he resisted, and each time he did so he saw to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
joy that another beautiful white camel joined the
growing caravan.</p>

<p>Then came the temptation of the sun, which
the white leader plucked lazily out of the sky and
smashed in pieces like a ripe melon on a salver
which camel servants held before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see it&#8217;s a pineapple with its skin taken off,&#8221;
the old camel remarked dreamily, as if it were of
no importance at all. &#8220;It has a wonderful flavor&mdash;not
like real fruit, of course, because it comes
from heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks awfully good,&#8221; said the youngest
camel, and he felt his mouth watering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no earthly reason why you
shouldn&#8217;t have a piece. I&#8217;m going to,&#8221; said the old
white camel, and he indolently chose the biggest,
juiciest bit and put it in his mouth. The little
camel stood watching him enviously as he chewed,
and licked his own parched lips thirstily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My mother
told me it wasn&#8217;t true about the sun being a pineapple,
so perhaps there&#8217;s something queer about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mothers have so much on their minds that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
they can&#8217;t remember any more what things are real
and what aren&#8217;t,&#8221; said the old camel while the
juices dribbled down his chin. &#8220;If you just take a
piece you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s true enough. It&#8217;s very refreshing
and much better than anything you&#8217;ve ever
tasted before. It&#8217;s rather like ice cream, only a
great deal nicer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He selected another ripe, golden piece and conveyed
it lazily to his lips, and the little camel
turned his head away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think my mother would want me to,&#8221;
he said, and immediately another white camel
joined the procession which was beginning to
reach almost out of sight across the sands.</p>

<p>Then came the temptation to run like a coward
from a flock of vultures which swarmed about him,
the blood still bright on their beaks; and then the
temptation to gather up some of the fine false
teeth which appeared like shells by the dunes, and
put them in his pocket for his mother; and then
the temptation to take the way through the grassy,
fertile valley under the shade of trees, as the old
leader advised him to do, instead of stumbling
across the barren badlands. All these and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
more temptations he resisted, and now the caravan
of white, golden-hoofed camels stretched far beyond
the horizon.</p>

<p>As they went slowly on, he caught sight of a
group of young camels like himself who were
romping and playing together on the edge of an
oasis not far away. He could hear their happy
shouts of laughter, and his sad, weary heart was
suddenly made glad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; he cried out, and the old white
camel seemed to start from sleep at the sound of
his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, what?&#8221; he mumbled, leaning up on his
cushions and rapidly blinking his eyes. &#8220;What did
you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at those other children over there!&#8221; the
youngest camel cried out in excitement. &#8220;Do you
see them? They seem to be having such a good
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, run along and join them for a bit,&#8221;
said the old white camel, lolling back on his cushions
and stifling a yawn. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stop long, but
we&#8217;ll excuse you for a few minutes while you get
acquainted.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;Oh, thank you, thank you!&#8221; cried the little
camel, and with a skip and a jump he was off
towards the green oasis where the other young
camels were playing leapfrog in the shade. He felt
like a brand-new, happy, well-fed little camel just
from seeing such happiness and such carefree
antics after all the experiences he had been
through.</p>

<p>So as fast as his legs would go he trotted towards
them over the sand, thinking of nothing but how
wonderful it would be to play with children like
himself again. But suddenly the wind began to
rise, and its wailing filled his ears. And now he saw
a white cloud coming swiftly across the sky. In
another instant, the sand dervishes sprang up in
spirals before him, and whirled and spun wildly in
his path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back, go back!&#8221; whispered one as the wind
flung her against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn around, turn around before it&#8217;s too
late!&#8221; murmured another, and the little camel
stopped short in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to the caravan!&#8221; another breathed in
a hushed voice in his ear as she threw her sandy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
arms around his neck. &#8220;This is one of the temptations!
Run back to the white leader as quickly as
you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>The youngest camel&#8217;s knees went weak beneath
him as he realized the terrible thing he had almost
done, and now he turned and began tottering back
to the caravan. No sooner had he taken the first
step than the wind&#8217;s voice died away and the sand
dervishes sank down motionless about him on the
desert. In another moment he was back beside the
litter on which the old white camel lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you changed your mind in time,&#8221; said
the leader with a yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; said the little camel in a trembling
voice, and although he could not see it, another
snow-white camel took its place at the end of the
caravan miles and miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time&#8217;s getting on,&#8221; said the old white leader
as the litter began to move forward again. &#8220;Nearly
all our companions are with us now. After another
few temptations, the circle around the earth will
be complete and then you will join your mother.
But, of course, the hardest things have been saved
up till the end.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Next came the temptations of salt and tobacco,
and the little camel looked at them with longing
eyes. For a moment he could not make up his
mind what to do, because his mother had always
told him since his earliest days that salt and
tobacco were so rare and so tasty that never, under
any conditions, must he dream of refusing them.
She said they were part of the daily fare of rajahs
and pashas and kings, and if a poor camel ever had
the luck to get near them, he should snatch them
up as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is just a little pick-me-up to give you the
strength to keep on going until evening,&#8221; said the
white leader casually, and he held the nice assortment
out under the youngest camel&#8217;s sensitively
quivering nose. &#8220;They&#8217;re something like Turkish
delight, only ever so much better. Anyway, they&#8217;re
not a real meal in any sense of the word, and it
can&#8217;t possibly do any harm if you try a little. Just
lick a bit of the salt to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little camel set his chin firmly and
shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, but I think I&#8217;d rather
not,&#8221; he said, and instantly another white camel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
with golden hoofs joined the end of the caravan
almost twenty thousand miles away.</p>

<p>Temptation after temptation followed this, and
the little camel bravely resisted them all. There
was the temptation to pick up his harp when he
saw it lying before him on the sand, and the temptation
to send a message to his mother by a bird of
paradise who flew down close to him and said he
knew just where she was and that he could take it
to her without any trouble. And then, just as the
sun was sinking beyond the desert&#8217;s horizon and
the little camel believed he had really come to the
end of his strength at last, he saw something so
marvelous just ahead that he thought he must be
dreaming. Yes, it was. No, it couldn&#8217;t possibly be.
But still it <i>was</i>. Yes, surely, it was. The more he
looked the more convinced he became, and suddenly
he jumped straight up into the air with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother! I can see my mother over there!&#8221;
he cried out, and the old white camel lifted himself
lazily on one elbow on his cushions to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must say it rather looks like her,&#8221; he
said, stifling a yawn. &#8220;I wonder what she&#8217;s doing
wandering about like that alone?&#8221; He sank back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
on his litter again and picked up his peacock-feather
fan. &#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s strayed from her caravan
and is wandering around in despair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s looking for me!&#8221; cried the little
camel in great excitement, but the white leader
only yawned again. She was jogging along just
ahead of them with her moth-eaten tail hanging
down behind, and the youngest camel cried
out: &#8220;It must be my mother! I know it&#8217;s my
mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one ever said it wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the old camel,
and this time it really sounded as if he were falling
asleep. &#8220;But you can&#8217;t possibly be sure at this distance
whether it&#8217;s your mother or just a striking
likeness&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t mistake my own mother, could
I?&#8221; asked the youngest camel, almost tearfully. &#8220;I
know the way her elbows look from the back, and
the way her hump humps&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s only one way of finding out for
certain,&#8221; said the white leader, with his heavy head
nodding drowsily. &#8220;You&#8217;d better skip along and
catch her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, would you excuse me for a minute while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
I do?&#8221; asked the little camel, so excited that he
could scarcely wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run along,&#8221; said the old white camel. &#8220;Anything&#8217;s
better than having you hemming and hawing
like this, but please don&#8217;t loiter on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old leader gave a terrific yawn at this and
stretched himself out as if for a long sweet sleep,
and without waiting another minute the youngest
camel started off in a gallop across the hot stretches
of sand. Faster and faster he went, stumbling over
his own feet, gasping and choking for breath, and
still he seemed to come no nearer to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; he cried out. &#8220;Mother! Wait, I&#8217;m
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice, she turned her head
over her shoulder and looked back at him and
smiled.</p>

<p>But just as it seemed he must reach her side at
last, a sudden burst of bright-feathered little birds
descended between them and set about his eyes
and ears like a swarm of bees. They were all chattering
wildly, and try as he would he could no
longer see to pass them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me go! Please let me go,&#8221; he pleaded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
but his words were drowned out by the whistling
and scolding of the scores and scores of birds.</p>

<p>Now that he had stopped, they settled at once
on his head and on his hump, while others flew
furiously before his eyes. If he turned in desperation
to the right or to the left, they pursued him,
chattering, while still others swung like tiny sharp-clawed
monkeys on his tail. He spun around, but
they were everywhere, increasing in numbers and
in fury with every instant that passed. Finally one
single brilliant bird poised herself before him on
the air and spoke these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to us once again. You have lost a great
deal of your conceit since we last met, and you have
almost entirely ceased to lie. Moreover, you have
learned to be polite to everyone you meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221; trilled all the birds in chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are much braver now, as well,&#8221; the single
bird&#8217;s voice went on, &#8220;and much humbler than
you ever were before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221; cried all the shrill little voices
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;So now, go back,&#8221; warbled the bird as she
dipped and winged before him on the air. &#8220;Go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
back, go back before the white leader wakes up
and sees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221; cried all the little birds at once,
and suddenly the youngest camel&#8217;s knees began to
shake under him as he asked himself if it was true
that this was just one more temptation which had
been put to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;but I&#8217;m sure&mdash;I&#8217;m sure&mdash;I&#8217;m
sure I saw my mother,&#8221; he protested, and as he
said this all the birds rose up from his back and
from his head and from his tail with a great rush
of tiny wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, four-footed child!&#8221; sang the single bird&#8217;s
voice to him. &#8220;Look ahead and look well at her.
She&#8217;s nothing. She&#8217;s just a reflection on the mists
of evening. Can&#8217;t you see she&#8217;s a mirage like the
oasis you followed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a mirage, a mirage, a mirage!&#8221; trilled the
hundreds of birds around him.</p>

<p>The youngest camel looked very hard at the
figure of his mother jogging along ahead, and now
it seemed to him indeed that there was something
rather hazy and misty about her such as he had
never noticed before. He turned in his tracks, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
just enough breath left to call out his thanks to the
birds, and then he made his way back to the caravan
as quickly as he could. His knees were still
quaking under him when he reached the litter&#8217;s
side, and from there he saw the flock of tiny bright
birds disappear like a sunset cloud into the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;So here you are after all!&#8221; exclaimed the old
white camel as he woke up with a start. &#8220;So you
came around to my way of thinking in the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; said the little camel, so tired by
this time that he could hardly stand. And as soon
as these words had passed his lips, the last pure-white
camel with golden hoofs joined the caravan
and the sun set with a jerk and a thousand torches
suddenly sprang alight the whole length of the
magic caravan. He could see the endless line of
camels girdling the earth with the torches carried
flaming on their heads and their gold hoofs shining
wondrously across the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather effective, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said the old white
leader, looking rather pleased at the whole display.
There were four tall torches lit about him now,
two at his head and two at his feet, and the diamonds
in his ornaments glittered in their light.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
&#8220;This is the part I like the best of the whole business
because it&#8217;s so near the end,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The old white camel put his peacock-feather
fan aside and fumbled in his cushions for a moment,
and then he drew forth the most beautiful
necklace the youngest camel had ever seen. All the
beads of it were of different colors and they were
strung together on a solid-silver string. There was
the bright red one, and the clear green one, and
the moonstone, and the diamond, and looking
closer he could make out the tiny lettering which
was carved in the center of each one. The little
camel could scarcely believe his eyes, and he
stepped closer to the litter and peered into the
brilliance of the torches&#8217; and jewels&#8217; light. And
now he saw that the jade bead had written inside
it: &#8220;I am the green valley you long for. You may
live in me forever.&#8221; And the topaz had written
within it: &#8220;I am a silk tent to protect you from
sandstorms and from winter and from the midday
sun.&#8221; And the ruby came next, and then the ivory
bead, and the amethyst, and the sapphire, and all
the others, exactly like the story he had told his
mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;These are magic beads,&#8221; the old camel said,
holding them up to the light. &#8220;They&#8217;re the most
valuable possession anyone can possibly have, because
they&#8217;re practically impossible. You see, if
they belong to you, then you can always have
everything you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know, I know!&#8221; cried the little
camel, clapping his hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you know about them?&#8221; asked the
white leader, just managing to swallow his yawn.
&#8220;I&#8217;m the only person in the world who knows
about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever tried them? Do they work?&#8221;
asked the youngest camel eagerly, and the old
white camel answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, excuse me,&#8221; said the little camel,
&#8220;but why don&#8217;t you live in a green valley forever
the way the jade bead says you can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I prefer to travel on a litter,&#8221; said the
white leader. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more restful and I see
more of the world this way, too. There&#8217;s nothing
I dread so much as being bored, and I know I&#8217;d be
awfully bored lying in a valley without any change
of scenery.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; said the youngest camel, doubtfully,
and after a moment he said: &#8220;If you&#8217;ll excuse
me again, I hope you won&#8217;t think I&#8217;m rude, but I
should like to know why you don&#8217;t press the
sapphire against your forehead for an instant and
have all your years drop from you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean turn myself young again?&#8221; asked the
big white camel in amazement. &#8220;Do you really
imagine I&#8217;d like to start way back at the beginning
again and do all the silly things I did over, and not
have people in every country of the world paying
me homage, and not be the leader of the caravan
of white camels any more?&#8221; He sank back in his
pillows again and gave a weary sigh. &#8220;I never
heard anything quite so silly in all my life,&#8221; he
murmured, lifting one hand to hide his gaping
mouth. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine anything more stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said the youngest
camel, and he stood looking with longing eyes at
the necklace he had never dreamed could really
be. &#8220;But then I should think if you have no more
use for the necklace you wouldn&#8217;t mind giving it
away, or at least lending it to people sometimes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally, as long as I have everything I want,
I haven&#8217;t the slightest use for it,&#8221; said the old white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
camel. &#8220;But so many people wanting it makes it
very valuable indeed. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s kept till the
very end like this. Now that you&#8217;ve resisted all the
temptations, you&#8217;re allowed to have a choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held the necklace up towards the flaming
torchlight again, and the little camel clasped his
hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say&mdash;do you mean I can
choose&mdash;&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221; said the old leader,
with a yawn. &#8220;This is the final test, remember.
You are allowed to choose between this string of
magic beads and&mdash;&#8221; he made a gesture towards a
great bulging sack which servants had just placed
on the sand beside his litter&mdash;&#8220;and this bag,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I do hope you&#8217;re not going to make a mistake
at the last minute,&#8221; he added dreamily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in the bag?&#8221; asked the little camel in a
cautious voice, and the old leader answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashes. Nothing but ashes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t see there&#8217;s any choice at all!&#8221; the
little camel cried out. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll take the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be in too much of a hurry to make
up your mind,&#8221; said the old white camel. &#8220;Remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
greed never got anybody anywhere at all.
Don&#8217;t forget that things are never what they seem,
and appearances are frequently deceiving. Keep
in mind that there are always a lot of wolves in
sheep&#8217;s clothing about, even right here on the
desert. If you&#8217;ll take my advice, you&#8217;ll consider
long and carefully before you&mdash;&#8221; The youngest
camel stood reflecting deeply while the old white
leader went on: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure your dear mother must
have told you all about fair faces hiding false
hearts, and I&#8217;m absolutely certain you don&#8217;t want
to act like a greedy little pig just when everything
seems to be turning out so nicely for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the little camel gravely, &#8220;but I want
the necklace. I don&#8217;t want the sack of ashes. I want
the necklace more than anything else in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the old camel, and in spite of
the fact that he was very much interested in the
conversation, his lids kept slipping down over his
eyes. &#8220;Naturally, we all want what isn&#8217;t good for
us. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to be a
silly, piggish little camel and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said the youngest camel in a small but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
firm voice. &#8220;I choose the necklace. That&#8217;s what I
want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must say that&#8217;s very unkind of you,&#8221;
said the old white leader, and he tossed it around
the little camel&#8217;s neck with rather a nasty jerk.
&#8220;No one&#8217;s ever chosen the necklace before and so
I was always able to keep it. Everyone&#8217;s <i>always</i>
chosen the bag of ashes because it was the politest
and nicest thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The youngest camel now fell down on his knees
and thanked the ancient leader for all the kindness
he had shown him, and as soon as he had paid him
enough homage to restore him to a good humor,
he turned the necklace around and around his
neck until he came to the bead which was shaped
like a heart and red as a cherry and he read the
inscription inside:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oh, heart, on music let me ride</div>
<div class="verse">This instant to my mother&#8217;s side.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But first he slipped the magic opal under his
tongue, so that by the time he reached his mother
and was clasped in her arms, all the lies he had
ever told her had been transformed to truth.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
